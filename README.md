The primary goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of Walmart Sales Data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can inform business decisions. The analysis spans from basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to more advanced techniques, including time series forecasting and predictive modeling. The project aims to shed light on branch performance, product lines, sales trends, and customer behaviour. Through meticulous data preparation, in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the creation of interactive visualizations using Power BI. I have extracted valuable insights that can inform business strategies and decision-making.

The insights derived from this analysis can significantly impact Walmart's operational efficiency and strategic planning. By understanding sales dynamics and customer behaviour, Walmart can improve its inventory management, optimize supply chain logistics, and tailor marketing strategies to enhance customer satisfaction and sales performance.

This project involved an in-depth analysis of Walmart's sales data, encompassing various dimensions such as sales performance by branch and city, customer demographics, product line performance, pricing and quantity analysis, payment methods, sales trends over time, and customer feedback. The comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering provided valuable insights that can drive strategic business decisions. This analysis has provided Walmart with a comprehensive understanding of its sales dynamics, customer preferences, and potential areas for growth. By implementing the recommended strategies, Walmart can optimize its operations, improve customer satisfaction, and drive overall business growth.

The project underscores the value of data-driven decision-making in retail, demonstrating how detailed data analysis can uncover hidden opportunities and provide actionable insights. Moving forward, continuous data monitoring and iterative improvements will be crucial for sustaining and enhancing Walmart's market position.
